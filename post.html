          <h2 class="section-heading">What is Toreba?</h2>
          
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/blog1/torebalogo.jpg"/>
          
          <p>For those of you who don't know what <a href="https://www.toreba.net/en/play" target="_blank">Toreba</a> is, it's a japan-based live claw machine app that allows you play and win 
            a whole variety of prizes, ranging from branded plushies, figurines, to apparels and other miscellaneous stuff.

          </p>

          <p>Global shipping is free every 7 days, so you'll be able to ship your winnings from japan all the way to your home, for free! </p>

          <p>You'll be given 5 free tickets when you first start out. Subsequently after the 5 tickets, you'll get a free ticket everyday which
            expires on 6am the following day. A ticket allows you to play most of the machines, with the exception of "TP only" machines which
            requires you to use TP which is Toreba's currency, in order to play.
          </p>

          <p>You can spend money on the game by purchasing TP which can be used
            to play the machines. The average TP required to play once is around 2000 TP, which equates to around 2USD per try. As of now, if you purchase
            10000 TP or above, you'll be awarded 1 extra free ticket everyday, and 3 extra free tickets on the 1st, 10th and 20th day of every month, which 
            is pretty worth it in my opinion if you just spend around $14 SGD to get the 10000 TP which entitles you to 1-3 extra free tickets everyday.
            Purchasing TP also allows you to queue and reserve the machines, which can come in handy and be quite advantageous as you get better at the game
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">It's a skills-based game</h2>

          <p> I've been playing Toreba regularly for around 6 months now, with 10 devices, which means I get 10 free tickets everyday. With these 10 daily tries, I've managed to snipe
            a total of around 70 prizes at this point of time where I'm writing here. It sounds easy, but it actually requires a lot of patience,
             experience and skills to win them. 
          </p>

          <p>Here are some tips for you to help you get better and hopefully win your first prize on the app!</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Watch and analyse toreba win compilations on youtube or reddit.</strong></li> <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn the different types of crane machines on the app and the different techniques you can use to win those prizes.</li><br>
              <li>Some pretty good channels are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoUBhVdjoiu36gV20oSRJA/videos" target="_blank">lijacky Japan</a>, 
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvK-2VgHyy8g021QaT20fAA/videos" target="_blank" >The Crane Game Addict</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Toreba/" target="_blank">r/toreba</a>. </li> <br>
               <li>(PS. I'm starting a youtube channel on toreba soon!)</li>
            </ul><br>
            <li><strong>Note the claw strength, how far the claws expand, and how low they go down.</strong></li><br>
            <ul>
              <li>It is crucial to take note of these when other players are playing, as these varies throughout
                the different machines, and it affects the playing style to win it.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Patience is the key to winning!</strong></li><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Whenever you see a prize that you think is going to drop, you might want to wait patiently for your chance to come, even if the queue is full.
                This is because you'll never know, sometimes everyone just quits playing for no reason when the prize is already in a one-shot position, and you can just snag the prize away!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

          

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">My experience</h2>

          <p>Other than a few unsuccessful disputes attempts to get my tickets refunded after spending them on some machines with bugs that prevent the claw from even
            going down, I've pretty much happy with my experience playing Toreba so far.
          </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/blog1/prizes.jpg">
        
          <span class="caption text-muted">My winnings so far, with around 27 more that have yet to be sent over. :D</span>

          <p>I mostly play machines with plushies as I find it to be way easier to win them as compared to figurines and other box shaped prizes.
            Most of the wins comes from machines with the prize being wrapped in plastic. I usually search for prizes with plastic edge on the tip
            of the bars, and if it looks like it's going to drop, I'll just use the claw to try to push/stab the prize down. 

          </p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">My snoopy win, using the stabbing/pushing method.</span>

          <p>That's all for now, I'll write an blog on Toreba winning techniques and skills when I'm free again, and start posting toreba videos on youtube too. :D</p>
